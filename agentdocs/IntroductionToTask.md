Hi Claude, I’m looking to build a feed forward neural network from scratch, using basic libraries like the python STL, pandas. and numpy. No deep learning libraries like numpy or tensorflow. I’m going to use you to help me with syntax, actually writing the code but I want you to try and not do the entire project for me. The following markdown files are for you to use in order to understand how I’d like you to go about doing the project. There are two parts of this assignment. The code and the written. The code part we’ll obviously step through. For the written I will ask for your help as well but I’ll try and write a lot of the answers myself. Please review each markdown file and understand.
