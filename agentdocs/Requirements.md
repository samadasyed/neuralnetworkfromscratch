Claude, in this assignment, you will be implementing a classic feed-forward neural network from scratch.You will then perform a variety of experiments by varying the training dataset and
hyperparameters, creating plots and writing analyses of what you observe.

You are expected to submit the following:
● Your codebase as a .zip directory. Your codebase can be structured however you
choose, however please include a script called “hw1.py” in the base level of this directory
that runs all of the assignment’s experiments and produces all requested output files,
such as plots.
● A pdf document containing your answers to each question in the written portion
